  description: As a member of Richland High School, I have taken many classes that I enjoy, including but not limited to computer science classes.
               I have taken AP Computer Science P as well as self studying for the Computer Acience A test. 
               I have also taken a multitude of math classes, culminating with AP Calculus BC this year. I am also involved in many clubs, such as 
               TSA Club in which our drone team went to national level in our first year competing.
